            Technology offers the potential to make life easier and more enjoyable; each new technology provides increased benefits. It also increases the complexities of use. If the products using these functionality are not designed properly, it leads to frustration with the technology. With emerging technologies like Internet of Things, there are many new products which can solve the urban city problems using technology. In this paper, I want to focus on the importance of human centered design of these smart products. The affordance of these smart products are different from the traditional products, which they have replaced. A trash can for example, affordance of a traditional trash can is for the people to dispose waste, a smart trash can on the other hand, can notify the cleaning agency, that it is full and needs maintenance. Technology has increased the affordance of the trash can. The technology that simplifies life by providing more functions in each device can also complicate life by making the device harder to learn and harder to use. This, in words of author Donald Norman, is the paradox of technology and the challenge for the designer. Interaction design works successfully with several design principles that are widely implemented and used in the community of designers. Urban designers and architects who are building these smart products should answer to similar questions, as the interaction designers in Human Computer Interaction. A focus on the quality and enjoyment of the total experience, of these smart products will make our cities more livable and user-friendly.
