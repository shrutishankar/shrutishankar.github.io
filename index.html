                <p>I am self motivated, hard working, a team player who has the skill and the will to keep learning.</p>
                <p> I have 3 years of work experience as a web developer at NCR Corporation, I was lucky enough to get an opportunity
                    to work with some great people and learn quickly. Though I have worked in all aspects of web development,
                    I like to design and develop User Interfaces. My work in UI landed me to an UX training, in my previous organization.
                    This introduced me to UX designing and increased my eagerness to learn more about it. I wish to be a User Experience developer someday.
                </p>
                <p> While working I always wanted to learn more about User experience, Big Data, Project Management and Android mobile development.
                    So, I decided to pursue my second master's degree, at Bentley University, which covers all the technologies I was looking to learn.
                </p>
                <p>I like to read all kinds of fiction, especially sci-fi. I also like to bake and hike.</p>

                <p> I started my career as a software intern at NCR Corporation India Pvt Ltd.</p>
                <p> My first few projects were to develop end to end website in CMS Joomla. The internship groomed me as a web developer.
                    User interface development and design was the part which interested me the most.
                    I am thankful to my mentor and my first manager for giving me the liberty to try out new things and encourage my work.
                </p>
                <p> My internship was converted into full-time. Now, I was a part of projects, which were more crucial for my company's business.
                    I built a dashboard to help track daily exchange of over 200,000 EDI documents. The application provided the customers
                    exchange information in the desired formats and served as a document consumption tool. On this project, I acquired
                    not only business and process knowledge, but also got experience in UNIX, Oracle 11g and Java. It was exciting to learn
                    how this webapp was so important, but still a cog in the big machine.
                </p>
                <p> I also built a reporting tool to understand NCR customers and monitor MOM and YOY growth in business.This was used internally to makes
                    strategic decisions for growing the business. Also used internally at NCR to track exchanged information with customers.
                    I participated in the annual innovation challenge, our idea, an android application (we were a group of 2)
                    was appreciated and went on to be a full project. As a part of the project we had developed a blueprint of our idea.
                    I worked on the front-end of the blueprint, and my friend developed the web service. This project also helped me understand
                    the work of other teams, which earlier a black box to me. This challenge made our team, a part of the innovation council.
                    As I had worked on the front-end I got selected for an external 3-day user-experience.
                </p>
                <p> I would say this was the turning point of my career, my performance at the training gave me an opportunity to work at the user experience COE.
                    Our job was to introduce the concepts of user experience across the company. I conducted events to build prototypes and help developers
                    understand the importance UX.I was a part of the team that created the UX guidelines for NCR applications.
                </p>
                <p> In pretext to learn more, I decided to return to the academic field, I left my job and I am now pursuing masters.
                    I am also work part-time as a web developer at Bentley University.
