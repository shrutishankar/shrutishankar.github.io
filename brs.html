        <p> Technology has always solved our problems and helped us acheive our goals.
            It has rapidly evolved and connected the entire world.
            I will explain how it solved the problem of bentley students.
            Commute has always been a problem for students as they have different schedules
            and everyone does not have their own vehicles. The one who do often ride alone and like to have company.</p>
        <p> We a team of 4, designed and developed an android application, which enables students to share rides with
            fellow students. We used the diverge and converge method to develop this product.
            The project was broken down into user stories and agile methodology was used for development.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>We have two users, the driver/vehicle owners and the riders</li>
            Features
            <li>Login Page-- Login using Bentley ID and Password. We will be MySQL as database, which was hosted on
                Bentley University servers.
                The first page/dialog box will ask, if the user is a driver or a rides.
            </li>
            <li>For driver: The second page will be a form, which will ask for his schedule,
                home address and destination (Bentley university by default),
                upper limit (How many people can ride in the vehicle) and other detais
                For Rider: A form which will ask for the home address and schedule and other detais
            </li>
            <li>The drivers will be shown all the riders in 2km vicinity as markers on google maps.
                Google map APIs were used for this interface.
                The riders: will see all the available rides on their routes,
                the results will be filtered by, the upper limit set by the drives
            </li>
            <li>The driver can select the best suited route and the riders can selected the best route.
                The driver will be notified of a new rider and can accept or reject a new rider.
                If driver accepts, the rider will be notified and contact details will be shared
            </li>
            <li>A reminder will be added for the drivers as well as riders 2 hours before the schedule.
                Any cancellation or change on the route will be notified through push notifications
            </li>
            <li>The application will have text and call features for the drivers and the riders on the same route</li>
            <li>We will also introduce a text-to-speech feature, so that,
                if need be, the driver can communicate with the riders even while driving
            </li>
            <li>The riders can track the vehicle, using the application,
                provided the location of the driver is turned on.
            </li>
        </ul>
